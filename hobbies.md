<br>I thoroughly enjoy carrying my camera📷 with me to capture the life! I have a particular fondness for documenting human stories, landscapes, and street photography. It would be even better if I could find someone willing to be my model🥰

<br>I find solace in engaging in individual physical activities, such as swimming 🏊‍, strength training 💪, and cycling 🚲. As my vision blurs amidst the perspiration, a serene tranquility envelops me.

## Music

<br>Recently, I have been trying to get into guitar playing and have increasingly come to appreciate the beauty of blues music. I hope that one day I will be able to play this style as well.

## Programming

As a coding enthusiast, I am just a novice, but you can discover some interesting projects in my [GitHub repositories and starred repositories](https://github.com/Yun-Tianming).
